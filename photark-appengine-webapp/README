PhotoArk Gallery Application
======================================

Apache PhotArk will be a complete open source photo gallery 
application including a content repository for the images, 
a display piece, an access control layer, and upload capabilities. 
The idea is to have a rigid design for the content repository 
with a very flexible display piece. The images in the content
repository will be protected with granular access control.
